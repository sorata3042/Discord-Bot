# Discord-Bot

The main file is the discord-bot.py file. The rest of the .py files are placed in a separate folder labeled /cogs. 

In order for the program to run there should be a token.txt file that contains a token pulled from the discord developer portal. 
My token is not uploaded for bot security. 

For messages.py the code requires two folders called /Mocha and /Billy. 
These two folders contain images since the two commands that require them are for sending images.
