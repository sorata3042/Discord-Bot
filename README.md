# Discord-Bot

## Description
Documentation for discord python api: [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=610685983242846219&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add my bot to a discord server and type !help for all of the commands. 

The main file is the discord-bot.py file. The rest of the .py files are placed in a separate folder labeled /cogs. 

In order for the program to run there should be a token.txt file that contains a token pulled from the [discord developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/). 
My token is not uploaded for security. 

## Requirements
For messages.py the code requires two folders called /Mocha and /Billy. 
These two folders contain images since the two commands that require them are for sending images.

Procfile and requirements.txt are needed for me to run my bot on [heroku](https://heroku.com/).
